# Ansic
*The most efficient and easy ansi styling crate ever!*

Ansic is a crate which adds the ansi! proc macro, which allows for easy, simple and zero cost styling which happens at compiletime, in addition to other ansi utilities.

## Features:
- Compiletime styling with proc macro
- Zero cost at runtime
- Encoded in static str's

## Usage:
To make a red foreground, bold and underline ansi
```rust
ansi!(red bold underline)
```

All color arguments can take these arguments:
- "br" - bright
- "bg" - background
(rgb can only take bg)

You can chain them like this if we want a red background:

```rust
ansi!(bg.red bold underline)
```

Or if you want a red bright background you can do this:
```rust
ansi!(bg.br.red bold underline)
```

In addition we can add a foreground color now that we have a background one. Let's add green!
```rust
ansi!(bg.br.red green bold underline)
```

Idiomatic ansic syntax is also storing styles in constants and using them to style in a much less verbose way:

```rust
const ERROR: &str = ansi!(br.red bold underline italic);
const RESET: &str = ansi!(reset);

fn main() {
    println!("{ERROR}[ERROR]: Hello, world!{RESET}");
}
```

Ansic has alot more styles which you can find on our docs.rs page: [Ansic on Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ansic);
Ansic also has util macros and functions for more convenient use (listed under Comparisons)
